This issue needs addressing                        due to the adverse effects it has on one’s metabolism.                        Based on six superstar ingredients reviewed by Dr. Stone                        hailing all the way from Madagascar, the Meticore                        supplement formula addresses metabolism, blood sugar,                        and waistline while supporting a healthy heart, joints                        and brain.

And according to the formulators of Meticore, this                        is because of the supplement’s ability to target the                        root cause of metabolic slowdown and weight loss which                        is too high of core body temperature.                     </p>                  </div>               </div>            </section>            <section class="why">               <div class="why__container container">                  <h2 class="why__title title">                     Why is low core/basal body temperature an issue?                  </h2>                  <div class="why__desc desc">                     <p>                        A low core/basal body temperature is usually anything                        below 36 degrees Celsius. That said, existing findings                        have concluded that low body temperature has been linked                        to hypothyroidism.                     </p>                     <p>                        Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid gland is performing                        at low rates, which leads to unexplained weight gain,                        the inability to lose weight despite all of the efforts                        that have been taken, low energy levels, and in some                        cases, hair loss among others.                     </p>                     <p>                        The main issue here is that the metabolic rate is                        determined based on the thyroid gland’s ability to                        release hormones. In the case of women, they typically                        experience low body temperature for a part of each                        month, namely because of ovulation and their menstrual                        cycles, but this should never be permanent. Ultimately,                        Meticore has been founded on this exact issue for                        helping users experience optimal metabolism and desired                        weight.                     </p>                     <p>                        Most people do not realize how important body                        temperature is to maintain a healthy ecosystem. However,                        one only has to know or remember what getting a fever                        entails, from chills and shivering to sweating,                        headaches, muscle aches, loss of appetite or                        dehydration, maintaining a healthy body temperature is                        always in one’s best interest for overall wellness and                        energy.

Weight loss methodologies, both natural and                        unnatural, have become common, and many medicines claim                        that they can aid in weight loss. More often than not,                        these solutions require a lot of time, effort, and money                        and are not universally applicable.                     </p>                     <p>                        Millions of people are struggling with obesity, which                        affects both physical and mental health. The most common                        reason for gaining an incredible amount of weight is                        unhealthy diet and eating habits and lack of physical                        activity and exercise. However, many researchers have                        shown that obesity results from an irregular sleeping                        cycle or slowed down metabolism. An abrupt gain in                        weight may cause a person to lose hope and motivation                        because they are unable to reach their ideal weight                        goals. This has changed, with the introduction of the                        Meticore’s all-natural supplement.                     </p>                     <p>                        With years of research, the manufacturers of Meticore                        have found the perfect solution to fasten the metabolism                        process through natural and organic ingredients.

So, by addressing body temperature,                        Meticore also revives one’s metabolism.                     </p>                     <p>                        The ingredients and the advanced formula used in this                        product is what makes it effective and unique. This                        supplement is made using the natural and purest                        ingredients extracted from organic sources. After the                        ingredients are extracted, they are taken to a lab for                        tests that ensure their quality and effectiveness. Each                        ingredient is bottled with extreme virility and provides                        that it is active and serves its purpose to the                        consumer.                     </p>                     <p>                        pAs for the supercharging nutrients responsible for such                        positive changes, there are six of them, but only six                        have been revealed to date:                     </p>                  </div>                  <div class="ingredients__items">                     <div class="ingredients__item item-ingredients">                        <h3 class="item-ingredients__title title title_small">                           African mango                        </h3>                        <p class="item-ingredients__desc desc">                           African mango, commonly referred to as Irvingia                           Gabonensis, is a natural substance that has been                           included in weight loss supplements. The reason for                           this rests in its nutrients, which allegedly combine                           fiber, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and fatty                           acids. That said, its uses can support one’s                           metabolism, suppress appetite, and increase energy                           levels, among others.                        </p>                     </div>                     <div class="ingredients__item item-ingredients">                        <h3 class="item-ingredients__title title title_small">                           Brown seaweed extract (fucoxanthin)                        </h3>                        <p class="item-ingredients__desc desc">                           Fucoxanthin is a type of antioxidant found in brown                           seaweed extract. Although clinical trials are minimal                           on its role, existing studies have since concluded                           that it can fight off common health issues such as                           obesity, diabetes, and inflammation. In terms of                           obesity, it seems like this ingredient inhibits                           lipases. Others suggest that seaweed carries a lot of                           prebiotic effects, which ultimately tend to one’s gut                           and digestive health.                        </p>                     </div>                     <div class="ingredients__item item-ingredients">                        <h3 class="item-ingredients__title title title_small">                           Ginger and Turmeric                        </h3>                        <p class="item-ingredients__desc desc">                           Ginger falls within the category of thermogenic foods                           along with its companion turmeric (aka the golden                           herbal spice), a medicinal herbal compound group that                           helps to heal the body so that one’s metabolism is up                           and running.

While                        it may be difficult to overlook or forget the lack of                        transparency when it comes to the nutritional facts and                        the company responsible for Meticore, the company does                        exhibit strong branding in the form of a forward-facing                        presentation, money back guarantee and rock solid refund                        policy for anyone not happy within 60 days of using the                        healthy metabolism support.                     </p>                     <p>                        There are many linked citation studies about all of the                        individual ingredients for Meticore. Many of the                        nutrients mentioned above do not seem to boost body                        temperatures directly, but one – however that is the                        main component and the others do all have powerful                        properties in terms of metabolic optimization, fat                        burning and general health benefits. The mystic of                        Meticore may be a turn off to some consumers, but in a                        sea of weight loss supplements and metabolism boosters,                        there is only one that specifically aims to target low                        body core temperature and pegs that as the root cause of                        weight gain. Another aspect that has been vaguely                        discussed is the marketed “long-term use,” where the                        team suggests three or six bottles based on “their                        research.” However, details on how this was carried out                        have been hidden at the time of writing.                     </p>                     <p>                        Given the gravity of metabolic slowdown as we age, the                        troublesome nature of obesity and being overweight, to                        the severity of high blood pressure, the healthy                        metabolism support supplement from Meticore is a                        sure-fire way to take a no-risk chance at improving all                        of these vital health signs naturally, with a rock solid                        money back guarantee all consumers can depend on from a                        reputable company and strongly-positioned brand.                     </p>                     <p>                        Act now and receive Meticore healthy metabolism support                        supplement for a staggering 80% off today while supplies                        last at these recently-released prices right now.                     </p>                  </div>                  <div class="verdict__img">                     <picture><source srcset="./img/verdict/img.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="./img/verdict/img.png" alt="" /></picture>                  </div>                  <a href="https://www.digistore24.com/content/348520/30424/yegor98?page=discover" class="verdict__btn btn">                     <picture><source srcset="./img/btn.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="./img/btn.png" alt="" /></picture>                  </a>               </div>            </section>         </main>         <footer class="footer">   <div class="footer__container container">      <a         href="mailto:copyright@meticoreofficialstore.com"         class="footer__contact"         >copyright@meticoreofficialstore.com</a      >   </div></footer>      </div>      <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script><!-- <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-3.0.1.min.js"></script> --><script src="js/main.min.js"></script>   </body></html>
